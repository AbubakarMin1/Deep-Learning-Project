        "\n",
        "This notebook tests the baseline megadetector on the COD10K dataset. It evaluates the detector only, which detects animals correctly only 50% of the time. The notebook doesn't contain an evaluation of the classifiers however, we did test the 3 classifiers provided by Pytorch Wildlife manually, and they performed really bad, almost classifying 1 of 4 images correctly. A mini evaluation report is shown as the output of the second last cell where it shows how many images were classified correctly and how many were not. The average confidence level is also reported.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why we didn't evaluate the classifiers:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This project's pipeline is that the detector first detects an animal and then sends it to the classifier, we have found that the detector fails 50% of the time, which means improving it should be our first priority, and not the classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Moving Forward**:\n",
        "\n",
        "We aim to do 2 things moving forward, firstly improve the detector using state of the art COD models such as HighResNet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Secondly, we were able to make some progress obtaining the LILA Dataset, which is actually the most relevant dataset to this project since its the only one containing camera trap images. We hope to have obtained a relevant subset of the LILA dataset by the next checkpoint and have tested the megadetector on it as well, maybe then we could move towards improving the classifiers of Pytorch Wildlife.  \n",
